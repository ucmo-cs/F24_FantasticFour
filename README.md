# Loan Repayment Tracker
This application will serve as a customer-facing system for managing scheduled loan repayment. After a
customer has taken out a loan with the bank a staff member will use an admin portal to load the loan
into the system and manage the repayment details of all customers. Customers will be able to log in to
the portal and manage the details of their repayment.
